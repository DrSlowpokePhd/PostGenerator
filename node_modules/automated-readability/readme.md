Formula to detect the ease of reading a text according to the [automated
readability index][formula].

## Install

This package is ESM only: Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed
instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install automated-readability
```

## Use

```js
import {automatedReadability} from 'automated-readability'

// For:
//
// The rule of rhythm in prose is not so intricate. Here,
// too, we write in groups, or phrases, as I prefer to call
// them, for the prose phrase is greatly longer and is much
// more nonchalantly uttered than the group in verse; so
// that not only is there a greater interval of continuous
// sound between the pauses, but, for that very reason,
// word is linked more readily to word by a more summary
// enunciation. Still, the phrase is the strict analogue
// of the group, and successive phrases, like successive
// groups, must differ openly in length and rhythm. The
// rule of scansion in verse is to suggest no measure but
// the one in hand; in prose, to suggest no measure at all.
// Prose must be rhythmical, and it may be as much so as
// you will; but it must not be metrical. It may be
// anything, but it must not be verse.
//
// Containing 6 sentences, 151 words, and 623 characters.
automatedReadability({
  sentence: 6,
  word: 151,
  character: 623
})
// => 10.585982…
```
