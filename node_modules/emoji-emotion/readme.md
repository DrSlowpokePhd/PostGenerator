List of emoji rated for valence with an integer between minus five (negative)
and plus five (positive).

## Install

This package is ESM only: Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed
instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install emoji-emotion
```

## Use

```js
import {emojiEmotion} from 'emoji-emotion'

console.log(emojiEmotion.slice(0, 5))
```

Yields:

```js
[ { name: '100', emoji: '💯', polarity: 3 },
  { name: 'angry', emoji: '😠', polarity: -3 },
  { name: 'anguished', emoji: '😧', polarity: -3 },
  { name: 'astonished', emoji: '😲', polarity: 2 },
  { name: 'black_heart', emoji: '🖤', polarity: 3 } ]
```

Note the information is intentionally limited.
Check out [`gemoji`][gemoji] for more info: tags, descriptions, names, etc.

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `emojiEmotion`.
There is no default export.

### `emojiEmotion`

`Array.<Info>`, where each object has `name` (`string`), `emoji` (`string`), and
`polarity` (`number`).

## Data

The included emoji are the faces and cats defined by [Unicode][].
The polarity was hand classified (by one person) based on the names of these
emoji (sometimes synonyms) and their [AFINN-165][] values.
Special care was given to **not** classify based on the images (as [different
vendors use different pictograms][checkmoji]), but only on words and how they
are used.

Note that some emoji receive arguably confusing polarities, such as
`stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes` (`0`), due to being used for both positive and
negative emotions.

No images are included in this repository: the copyrighted material may or may
