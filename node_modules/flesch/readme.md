Formula to detect the grade level of text according to the [Flesch reading
ease][formula].

See [`syllable`][syllable] for detecting syllables.

## Install

This package is ESM only: Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed
instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install flesch
```

## Use

```js
import {flesch} from 'flesch'

// For “The cat sat on the mat” (1 sentence, 6 words, 6 syllables).
flesch({sentence: 1, word: 6, syllable: 6}) // => 116.14500...

// For “The Australian platypus is seemingly a hybrid of mammal and reptilian
// creature.” (1 sentence, 12 words, 23 syllables).
flesch({sentence: 1, word: 12, syllable: 23}) // => 32.50499...
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `flesch`.
There is no default export.

### `flesch(counts)`

Given an object containing the number of words (`word`), the number of sentences
(`sentence`), and the number of syllables  (`syllable`) in a document, returns
the reading ease associated with the document.

Returned values are 120 (every sentence consisting of only two one-syllable
words), or lower (including negative values).

The values have the following semantics:

|     Score    | Semantics                                           |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| 90.0 – 100.0 | Easily understood by an average 11-year-old student |
|  60.0 – 70.0 | Easily understood by 13- to 15-year-old students    |
|  0.0 – 30.0  | Best understood by university graduates             |

Therefore we can use the following formula to approximate the average age a
student would understand a document at, given score `score`:

```js
var age = 20 - Math.floor(score / 10)
```
