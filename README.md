# Post Generator

This is Post Generator, a simple, template-based social media post generator for my game **The Moderator**.
What it does is transform a piece of text into a slightly different piece of text by using the power of ***NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING*** and genetic programming.
See, *The Moderator* is a game that relies on a lot of text being written for it, a lot of really, *really* menial and tedious text being written for it. This utility is designed to solve that issue by entirely automating that process.
Eventually, I hope that this utility can be used to help more indie developers automate the more tedious writing process of creating character dialogue for NPCs at scale (~1,000-100,000).
